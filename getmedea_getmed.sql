These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and in atopic individuals. If an allergic reaction occurs, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid therapy should be discontinued and appropriate alternative therapy instituted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the case that an infection is proven to be due to an amoxicillin-susceptible organisms(s) then consideration should be given to switching from amoxicillin/clavulanic acid to amoxicillin in accordance with official guidance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This presentation of Co-amoxiclav may not be suitable for use when there is a high risk that the presumptive pathogens have resistance to beta-lactam agents that is not mediated by beta-lactamases susceptible to inhibition by clavulanic acid. As no specific data for T&gt;MIC are available and the data for comparable oral presentations are borderline, this presentation (without additional amoxicillin) may not be suitable for the treatment of penicillin-resistant&nbsp;<em>S. pneumoniae</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Convulsions may occur in patients with impaired renal function or in those receiving high doses (see section 4.8).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid should be avoided if infectious mononucleosis is suspected since the occurrence of a morbilliform rash has been associated with this condition following the use of amoxicillin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Concomitant use of allopurinol during treatment with amoxicillin can increase the likelihood of allergic skin reactions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prolonged use may occasionally result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The occurrence at the treatment initiation of a feverish generalised erythema associated with pustula may be a symptom of acute generalised exanthemous pustulosis (AGEP) (see Section 4.8). This reaction requires Co-amoxiclav discontinuation and contra-indicates any subsequent administration of amoxicillin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid should be used with caution in patients with evidence of hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.8).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hepatic events have been reported predominantly in males and elderly patients and may be associated with prolonged treatment. These events have been very rarely reported in children. In all populations, signs and symptoms usually occur during or shortly after treatment but in some cases may not become apparent until several weeks after treatment has ceased. These are usually reversible. Hepatic events may be severe and in extremely rare circumstances, deaths have been reported. These have almost always occurred in patients with serious underlying disease or taking concomitant medications known to have the potential for hepatic effects (see section 4.8)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Antibiotic-associated colitis has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents including amoxicillin and may range in severity from mild to life threatening (see section 4.8). Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhoea during or subsequent to the administration of any antibiotics. Should antibiotic-associated colitis occur, Co-amoxiclav should immediately be discontinued, a physician be consulted and an appropriate therapy initiated. Anti-peristaltic drugs are contra-indicated in this situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Periodic assessment of organ system functions, including renal, hepatic and haematopoietic function is advisable during prolonged therapy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prolongation of prothrombin time has been reported rarely in patients receiving amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Appropriate monitoring should be undertaken when anticoagulants are prescribed concomitantly. Adjustments in the dose of oral anticoagulants may be necessary to maintain the desired level of anticoagulation (see section 4.5 and 4.8).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In patients with renal impairment, the dose should be adjusted according to the degree of impairment (see section 4.2).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In patients with reduced urine output crystalluria has been observed very rarely, predominantly with parenteral therapy. During administration of high doses of amoxicillin it is advisable to maintain adequate fluid intake and urinary output in order to reduce the possibility of amoxicillin crystalluria. In patients with bladder catheters, a regular check of patency should be maintained (see section 4.9).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During treatment with amoxicillin, enzymatic glucose oxidase methods should be used whenever testing for the presence of glucose in urine because false positive results may occur with non-enzymatic methods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The presence of clavulanic acid in Co-amoxiclav may cause a non-specific binding of IgG and albumin by red cell membranes leading to a false positive Coombs test.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There have been reports of positive test results using the Bio-Rad Laboratories Platelia Aspergillus EIA test in patients receiving amoxicillin/clavulanic acid who were subsequently found to be free of Aspergillus infection. Cross-reactions with non-Aspergillus polysaccharides and polyfuranoses with Bio-Rad Laboratories Platelia Aspergillus EIA test have been reported. Therefore, positive test results in patients receiving amoxicillin/clavulanic acid should be interpreted cautiously and confirmed by other diagnostic methods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1000 mg/200 mg powder for solution for injection or infusion</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This medicinal product contains 3.1 mmol of sodium per vial. To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1000 mg/200 mg powder for solution for injection or infusion</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This medicinal product contains 1.0 mmol of potassium per vial. To be taken into consideration by patients with reduced kidney function or patients on a controlled potassium diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oral anticoagulants</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oral anticoagulants and penicillin antibiotics have been widely used in practice without reports of interaction. However, in the literature there are cases of increased international normalised ratio in patients maintained on acenocoumarol or warfarin and prescribed a course of amoxicillin. If co-administration is necessary, the prothrombin time or international normalised ratio should be carefully monitored with the addition or withdrawal of amoxicillin. Moreover, adjustments in the dose of oral anticoagulants may be necessary (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Methotrexate</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Penicillins may reduce the excretion of methotrexate causing a potential increase in toxicity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Probenecid</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Concomitant use of probenecid is not recommended. Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin. Concomitant use of probenecid may result in increased and prolonged blood levels of amoxicillin but not of clavulanic acid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mycophenolate mofetil</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil, reduction in pre-dose concentration of the active metabolite mycophenolic acid (MPA) of approximately 50% has been reported following commencement of oral amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. The change in pre-dose level may not accurately represent changes in overall MPA exposure. A change in the dose of mycophenolate mofetil should not normally be necessary in the absence of clinical evidence of graft dysfunction. Close clinical monitoring should be performed during the combination and shortly after antibiotic treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pregnancy</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3). Limited data on the use of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid during pregnancy in humans do not indicate an increased risk of congenital malformations. In a single study in women with preterm, premature rupture of the foetal membrane it was reported that prophylactic treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid may be associated with an increased risk of necrotising enterocolitis in neonates. Use should be avoided during pregnancy, unless considered essential by the physician.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Breastfeeding</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both substances are excreted into breast milk (nothing is known of the effects of clavulanic acid on the breast-fed infant). Consequently, diarrhoea and fungus infection of the mucous membranes are possible in the breast-fed infant, so that breast-feeding might have to be discontinued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid should only be used during breast-feeding after benefit/risk assessment by the physician in charge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, undesirable effects may occur (e.g. allergic reactions, dizziness, convulsions), which may influence the ability to drive and use machines (see section 4.8).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.8 Undesirable effects</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most commonly reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ADRs derived from clinical studies and

When the child receives a booster dose, you will need to tell the doctor if the previous shot caused any side effects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your child can still receive a vaccine if he or she has a cold or fever. In the case of a more severe illness with a fever or any type of infection, wait until the child gets better before receiving Prevnar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Becoming infected with pneumococcal disease (such as pneumonia or meningitis) is much more dangerous to your child&#39;s health than receiving Prevnar. However, like any medicine, Prevnar can cause side effects.

Most people in this age group require only one Tdap shot for protection against these diseases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis are serious diseases caused by bacteria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.drugs.com/cg/tetanus.html\" onclick=\"ga(\'send\', \'event\', \'Content Link\', \'Tetanus\');\">Tetanus</a>&nbsp;(lockjaw) causes painful tightening of the muscles, usually all over the body. It can lead to &quot;locking&quot; of the jaw so the victim cannot open the mouth or swallow. Tetanus leads to death in about 1 out of 10 cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.drugs.com/mcd/diphtheria\" onclick=\"ga(\'send\', \'event\', \'Content Link\', \'Diphtheria\');\">Diphtheria</a>&nbsp;causes a thick coating in the nose, throat, and airways.

These spells can last for weeks and can lead to pneumonia, seizures (convulsions), brain damage, and death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diphtheria and pertussis are spread from person to person. Tetanus enters the body through a cut or wound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Boostrix is especially important for healthcare workers or people who have close contact with a baby younger than 12 months old.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Boostrix works by exposing you to a small dose of the bacteria or a protein from the bacteria, which causes the body to develop immunity to the disease. This vaccine will not treat an active infection that has already developed in the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like any vaccine, Boostrix may not provide protection from disease in every person.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Important information</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In most cases,Boostrix vaccine is given in only one dose. Follow your doctor&#39;s instructions about receiving a booster dose if needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can still receive the Boostrix vaccine if you have a minor cold. In the case of a more severe illness with a fever or any type of infection, wait until you get better before receiving Boostrix vaccine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should not receive Boostrix if you have ever had had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a tetanus, diphtheria, or pertussis vaccine. You also should not receive Boostrix if you had a neurologic disorder affecting your brain within 7 days after having a previous pertussis vaccine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Becoming infected with diphtheria, pertussis, or tetanus is much more dangerous to your health than receiving the Boostrix vaccine. However, like any medicine, this vaccine can cause side effects but the risk of serious side effects is extremely low</p>\r\n', '163960283_09-22-2018_0542am.jpeg'),

Ty21a is approved for use in children six years of age and older and requires three to four doses. The ViCPS vaccine is licensed for children two years of age and older with a booster dose required every two to three years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Are these vaccines safe and effective?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Studies show these two vaccines to be safe and to protect 50 to 80 percent of recipients. However, because neither vaccine gives lasting immunity or is approved for use in children younger than two years of age, they have limited potential health benefits. Neither vaccine is widely used in routine immunization programs or subsidized by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>What are typhoid conjugate vaccines?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newly available typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs) are made by linking (or &ldquo;conjugating&rdquo;) the Vi capsular polysaccharide to a more complex protein. Through conjugation, TCVs are able to stimulate parts of the immune system that the Vi polysaccharide vaccines cannot, thereby inducing a stronger, longer-lasting immunity among a broader age range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>What are the benefits of typhoid conjugate vaccines?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compared to the currently available vaccines, TCVs have longer-lasting protection, require fewer doses, and are suitable for children younger than two years of age, allowing delivery through routine childhood immunization programs. Expanded use of TCVs through routine immunization has the potential to reduce the need for antibiotics, slow further emergence of drug-resistant typhoid strains, and save lives.</p>\r\n', '2124242656_09-22-2018_0557am.jpg'),
